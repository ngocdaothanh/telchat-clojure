See: http://github.com/ngocdaothanh/telchat-scala

This is only an exercise of a Clojure newbie:
* Chat server: JBoss Netty
* Clients: telnet

== Usage

Download dependencies:
lein deps

Make standalone jar file:
lein uberjar

Start server on port 3000:
java -jar telchat-clojure-0.1-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

Connect to the server:
telnet localhost 3000

== OpenJDK

If you have problem compiling Telchat, make sure you are using Sun Java, not
OpenJDK (which is usually much slower).

On Ubuntu:
* sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
* sudo update-alternatives --config java
