This is only an exercise of a Clojure newbie:
* Chat server: JBoss Netty
* Clients: telnet programs

Usage:
* Run "make start" to start server
* Then telnet localhost 3000

You must have Maven2.

If you have problem compiling Telchat, make sure you are using Sun Java, not
OpenJDK (usually much slower). On Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
sudo update-alternatives --config java
