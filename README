This is only an exercise of a Clojure newbie:
* Chat server: JBoss Netty
* Clients: telnet

Usage:
* Run "make start" to start server, you must have Maven2
* Then run "telnet localhost 3000" to connect to the server

If you have problem compiling Telchat, make sure you are using Sun Java, not
OpenJDK (usually much slower). On Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
sudo update-alternatives --config java

Comments are very welcome. Please write in Issues:
