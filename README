This is only an exercise of a Clojure newbie:
* Chat server: JBoss Netty
* Clients: telnet programs

Usage:
* To compile: make, you must have Maven2
* To run: make start, then telnet localhost 3000

If you have problem compiling Telchat, make sure you are using Sun Java, not
OpenJDK (usually much slower). On Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
sudo update-alternatives --config java

Comments are very welcome. Please write in Issues:
