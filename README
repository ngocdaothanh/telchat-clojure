This is only an exercise of a Clojure newbie:
* Chat server: JBoss Netty
* Clients: telnet

== Usage

* mvn compile to compile Java file, you must have Maven2
* mvn clojure:compile to compile Clojure files, optional, only for static syntax check
* mvn clojure:run to start server on port 3000
* telnet localhost 3000 to connect to the server

== Notes

If you have problem compiling Telchat, make sure you are using Sun Java, not
OpenJDK (usually much slower). On Ubuntu:
* sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
* sudo update-alternatives --config java
